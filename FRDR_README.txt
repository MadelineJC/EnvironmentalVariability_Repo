DATA-SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR: ## ADD FILENAME or DIRECTORY NAME
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Each data file contains a nested list. The first list (object[[I]]) contains each frequency of disturbance. The second list (object[[I]][[j]]) contains each introduction day. The third list (object[[I]][[j]][[k]]) contains each magnitude of disturbance. Within each of these lists is a data frame (501 rows by 3001 columns). The first column of the data frame is a time series. Following this column are groups of three columns containing the population abundances of the primary parasite, the secondary parasite, and the host's immune response. Each group of three columns is one simulation out of 1000.
